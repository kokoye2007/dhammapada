Dhammapada
==========

A web book of the Dhammapada, based on the translation of venerable narada. 

Right now it pulls the images from http://what-buddha-said.net. There's a script that can pull down the images locally in ./app/images/hi

To run it, simply:

`npm install`

`bower install`

`grunt serve` 


And you should be good to go.
